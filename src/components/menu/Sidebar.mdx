# Sidebar

The `Sidebar` component is used to render the sidebar menu in the Open Formulieren admin-ui. The
`Sidebar` consists of the application title, a possible subtitle, and main navigation.

Using the React-router `useMatches`, the `Sidebar` determines which menu to render based on the
current route. Currently, the sidebar only renders the `FormDetailMenu` menu for the form detail
pages, and `MainMenu` for the top-level pages.
